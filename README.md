# ACCENTURE-VIRTUAL-EXPERIENCE

Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Experience Program on Forage

Description:

In this virtual case, I was assigned 4 tasks. 

--> Project understanding: The first task was to understand the clientâ€™s business, and the business problem they were facing, identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project, and the tasks that I, as a part of the Data Analytics team had to focus on.

--> Data cleaning and modelling: In the second task, I was provided a set of data sets, all containing different columns and values, as well as a data model. For this purpose, I used Microsoft Excel and had to create my own data set to use later for fulfilling the requirements of this task. Before merging tables, I had to ensure data cleaning and remove irrelevant, missing, and erroneous data from datasets. After that, I merged tables together by using the Unique Keys within the tables.

--> Data Visualization and storytelling: The third task was to bring the data set to life by creating insightful visualizations to address the requirements of the project, find relevant data insights and present it in the form of a PowerPoint presentation to my internal team and the client.

--> Present to the client: The fourth task was to use that slide deck along with storytelling techniques and record a video of myself presenting back to the client.
